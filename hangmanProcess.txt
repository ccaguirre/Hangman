OBJECTIVE

This program will allow the user to play hangman against the computer using a list of words from a txt file 
-Function that randomly selects a word from the text dictionary
-function that takes input from the user, which will be the letter guessed
-Function that will take the letters guessed correctly,and turn them into a string
-Need to create various variables to store the user's inputted data
    -Variable for the word that the computer picks
    -create a set of data that holds the letters guessed wrong and the letters guessed right by the user
-Need to display an intro to the program
-Need to build a repetitive system so that the user can keep guessing letters
-If the user guesses wrong, a new part of the body is drawn until they lose (guesses left goes down/wrong guesses go up)
-Add statements at the end and beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing
